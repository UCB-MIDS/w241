# Do some guided Yoga! 

Head to the datahub to work on an exercise. 

- If you want to pull all new changes from the master repo into the datahub, follow this [link](http://datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/UCB-MIDS/w241&branch=master&urlpath=rstudio)
- If you have set up your datahub to work off a fork that you are managing, instead follow this [link](https://datahub.berkeley.edu/user/USERNAME/rstudio/). 

Once you have the datahub open, navigate to `week_01>base_r.Rmd` to work on an exercise.

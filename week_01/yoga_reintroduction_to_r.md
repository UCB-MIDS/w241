# Coding in Class, Using Data Hub and R Studio
Throughout the semester, we're going to insert breaks in the lecture action to get you involved programming. There are two types of activity we will ask you do to: (1) Coding Yoga; and, (2) Coding Hikes.

1. **Yoga** is going to be *mellow*, highly guided sessions where we will be showing you things, in code, that we just been talking about in the async lectures. We want to get you thinking about the code structures that we're using, and this is the most effective way. 
2. **Hikes** are less structured than *yoga*. In a *hike*  your work is going to be self-guided. We will be providing data & context, some boilerplate, and a target to shoot for, but just how you get there will be up to you.

(I mean, you signed up for some Berkeley, right?) 

Not all weeks will have a code *hike* in them, but when we do, there will be only one per week, and it will be the last activity for the week. We will always let you know which you're working on, so you can set your expectations for time (and coffee) appropriately.

# The Berkeley DataHub 

For *in async* code demonstrations, we're going to use the UC Berkeley datahub. This is a lightweight compute system with a jupyter server and Rstudio server. You've got general access to this compute using your @berkeley.edu credentials. Don't get distracted by the link right now: but, this jupyter hub is housed at [r.datahub.berkeley.edu](https://r.datahub.berkeley.edu). If you're interested, you can read more about this compute system [here](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

There are two ways that you might interact with the datahub. 

1. You want to do your own work. In this case, you can get to the datahub by navigating directly to the datahub: heading to [r.datahub.berkeley.edu](r.datahub.berkeley.edu). 

2. You want to work on content that has been provided to you for the async. In this case, you might consider using the `nbgitpuller` links that are included in the course materials. 

The `nbgitpuller` is a small tool that is designed to keep your materials in sync with content that is provided for the course. In essence, it will pull content from the course repository to the datahub without you having to intervene. The full merging behavior is described [[here]](https://jupyterhub.github.io/nbgitpuller/topic/automatic-merging.html), but it is pretty careful to keep from clobbering work that you've done.  

The first time that you use the `nbgitpuller` link it may require as many as 60 seconds or so to complete the merging. But, after the first time, it will only pull differences. This means that the server should start, in general, in 30 seconds or less.

# Do Some Short Yoga! 
Head [here](http://r.datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/UCB-MIDS/w241&branch=master&urlpath=rstudio) and navigate to `week_01>reintroduction_to_r.Rmd` to work on an exercize.

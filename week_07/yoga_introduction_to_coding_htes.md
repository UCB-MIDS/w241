# Do a Longer Hike! 

Head to the datahub to work on an exercise. 

- If you want to pull all new changes from the master repo into the datahub, follow [this link](http://r.datahub.berkeley.edu/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https://github.com/UCB-MIDS/w241&branch=master&urlpath=rstudio). 
- If you have set up your datahub to work off a fork that you are managing, instead follow [this link](https://r.datahub.berkeley.edu/). 

Once on the UCB Datahub, navigate to  `week_07>introduction_to_coding_htes.Rmd` to work on an exercise.

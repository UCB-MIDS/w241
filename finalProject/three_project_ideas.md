# Three Project Ideas 

As a team, write the _Abstract_ of a paper reporting your experimental results, as though you have already successfully completed the experiment. This is a bit of creative fiction: quite clearly you have not yet conducted the experiment, but forming your project in this way can help to assess whether it is worth pursuing. 

Below is a loose suggestion for how to structure this abstract. You need not follow it _exactly_ but it is quite close to form. 

1. The first sentence, in the form of a question that is italicized, should state the research question under investigation. 
2. The second one or two sentences should provide context for why this question is interesting, including any existing observational or experimental work in the area. 
3. The next sentence should describe what your intervention is, and why you chose it. 
4. Then, _creatively_, but plausibly, describe the results that your experiment "has" generated.
5. Finally, describe the implications for what you have found.

# Example One 

Here is one example of an abstract of this form, written by Vitor Hadad, David A. Hirshberg, Ruohan Zhan, Stefan Wager, Susan Athey at _Proceedings of the National Academies of Science_ in 2021.

The article is here: https://www.pnas.org/content/118/15/e2014602118 and the abstract reads as the following: 

> Adaptive experimental designs can dramatically improve efficiency in randomized trials. But with adaptively collected data, common estimators based on sample means and inverse propensity-weighted means can be biased or heavy-tailed. This poses statistical challenges, in particular when the experimenter would like to test hypotheses about parameters that were not targeted by the data-collection mechanism. In this paper, we present a class of test statistics that can handle these challenges. Our approach is to adaptively reweight the terms of an augmented inverse propensity-weighting estimator to control the contribution of each term to the estimatorâ€™s variance. This scheme reduces overall variance and yields an asymptotically normal test statistic. We validate the accuracy of the resulting estimates and their CIs in numerical experiments and show that our methods compare favorably to existing alternatives in terms of mean squared error, coverage, and CI size.

# Example Two 

Here is another example of an abstact of this form, published by Nick Obradovich and (the courses' very own) Scott Guenther at _Climactic Change_ in 2016. 

The article is here: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-016-1670-9 and the abstract reads as the following: 

> _How can individuals be convinced to act on climate change?__ It is widely assumed that emphasizing personal responsibility for climate change is effective at increasing pro-climate behavior whereas collectively framing the causes of climate change diffuses responsibility and dampens the incentive for individual action. We observe the opposite result. Here we find, across three experiments, that emphasizing collective responsibility for the causes of climate change increases pro-climate monetary donations by approximately 7 % in environmental group members and by 50 % in the general public. Further, highlighting collective responsibility amplifies intent to reduce future carbon emissions. In contrast, focusing on personal responsibility for climate change does not significantly alter donations to climate change advocacy or the intent for future pro-climate behavior. These effects replicate and persist multiple days after treatment.

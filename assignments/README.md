# Overview 
This is the directory for assignments. Please write code relative to this repository, so that we can run tests to evaluate that your code runs and produces the correct solutions. 

# Approach to these problem sets 

Collaboration is **crucial**. The instructors benefited from working together as studetns (we were all students of the same UC San Diego PhD program); you will assuredly benefit from working together with your classmates.

- Set up regular working groups for the problem sets 
- Talk about the problem sets in our **whole class** Slack channel

However, collaboration does not mean:

- free-riding on your classmates;
- sending code without conversation, and especially, 
- downloading solutions from past semesters.

If you have a question of whether what you're doing is collaborative
or not, consider whether the person or thing on the other end of the
collaboration could benefit in some form. If the answer is no, or it
is murky, then it is not collaboration. 

In particular, We bet you can find a solution set for each of these
problem sets with enough looking around. Heck, if you want, We'll tell
you where they are.

*But, don't.*


# Problem Sets 

## Practice Problem Set
The practice problem set is ungraded, it is just a chance for you to get a sense for the project checkout and turn-in flow. 

## Problem Set 1
The first problem set is mostly conceptual and calculations that you can do with a phone calculator. We ask questions about what it means to cause, whether a particular data capture method can _possibly_ identify a cause, and to demonstrate some simple math about treatment effects. We'd prefer that students write `.Rmd` solutions, which will be relied upon heavily later in the course.  

## Problem Set 2
The second problem set asks students to implement a permutation-based inference algorithm, **randomization inference**, estimate treatment effects in data, and write a framework for a simulation-based power analysis that can be extended into their projects. Because there is considerably more coding in this problem set than the last, this problem set will likely require double the time of the first. 

## problem Set 3
The third problem set dives directly into working with data and building repetitions loading, cleaning, estimating and interpreting the core models for experimental data. This problem set continues to build coding craft for estimating causal models. This problem set will likely require more time than the second problem set.

## Problem Set 4 
The fourth problem set works with data that presents problems of compliance and models to address these problems. The problem set also provides a chance for students to expand their technical ability to run their computing system against a medium-sized data set. This problem set will likely require about the same amount of time as the third problem set.

## Problem Set 5
The fifth problem set closes out the semester with a familiar problem set flow. Student will continue to estimate linear models against data, using the models to explore and resolve problems that are present in data.

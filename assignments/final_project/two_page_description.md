# Two Page Description of Project 

As a team expand the abstract of your project from the one paragraph that you initially provided about the idea, into a more full description of the idea.

# Abstract 

Bring forward the abstract that you initially wrote and submitted as one of the three-ideas. If your idea has changed at this point, please modify the abstract to reflect these changes. 

# Theory 

Why do you think that the treatment that you are going to employ will change the measured behavior of the humans that receive it? Be specific. At this point, we are asking you to move beyond _arm-chair_ theory building to find specific statements of this theory in the academic or applied literature. 

## Concept Under Investigation 

What, _specific_ concept is the team interested in investigating? Is there academic literature has previously looked at this concept? Using [Google Scholar](scholar.google.com), what are the closest previous investigations that you can find? How did these investigations (a) think about the concept that you're investigating; and, (b) measure the concept that you're investigating?

## Treatment Variants 

What are the treatment and control that your subjects will experience? Include a picture, mock-up, or explain the important features of this experience. What sets them apart?

## Reason About Mechanisms 

Why do you think that your treatment will work the way that it will work? This is essentially a question about "mechanisms". Is there a way that you can design your experiment in order to explicitly _test_ these mechanisms that you have identified? Why or why not? 

As an example: suppose that you were investigating whether chocolate-chip cookies or broccoli make people happier and you reason that it is the chocolate in cookies that is the mechanism that actually makes people happier. Could you then design a cookie recipe that does not contain chocolate-chips and assess whether the cookie treatment then ceases to affect happiness.

# Rough Experiment Design 

Will the people that you recruit see either treatment _or_ control (a between-subjects design)? Or, will the people that you recruit see both treatment _and_ control (a within-subjects design)? Will you measure anything before you administer treatment? Will you measure anything after you administer treatment? 

# Recruitment 

Who are the humans that the team is going to recruit to participate in their experiment? How will the team be put into contact with these humans? As examples, these could be friends and family; or, people recruited through the Berkeley experiments lab; or individuals who browse onto a platform; or, individuals who walk through a park. 

# Feedback Returned from Instructor 

When you submit this two-page description of the project, you will also schedule time for a 20-minute meeting with your section instructor. As a group, your team and instructor will work-together to push the project forward.

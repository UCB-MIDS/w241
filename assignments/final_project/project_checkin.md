# Project Check-In

How are things going? This document, which should be no more than a page or two, is a chance for your to brief your instructor about your progress so that the team and instructor can have a productive check-in meeting.

# Possible Topics of Discussion 

Although there are no mandatory, or necessary points that you have to talk about, here are some options that you might talk about in your check-in.

## Treatment Design 

So frequently, this is the crux of any experiment: _What should we actually do?_ How has this design process proceeded? What has led you to believe that the content that your experimental are assigned is going to _cause_ differences in their behavior. Have you spoken with anybody (i.e. in a focus group, or interview) about your treatment and how it makes them feel? Is there published literature that makes you belive this will be true?

## Experiment Design 

Does the team have a clear experiment design? When, relative to treatment-assignment will subjects be measured? Before? After? Many times? Are there any concerns that people will opt-out of the treatment condition that you assign to them? Are there any concerns that people may opt-out of partipating in your experiment? Are there any concenrs that people will _forget_ they are a part of your experiment? 

## Measurement Design 

What is the team's strategy for measuring outcomes? 

- Is the team going to rely on "self-reported" survey data? If so, how accurate a measurement will this produce? What _specific_ question wording will the team be using in a survey? Share this with your instructor. 
- Is the team going to rely on "revealed preference" data like on-device clicks, purchases, or other _direct_ measurements of the outcome? If so, how has this been designed, and does it do a good job of capturing the concept that the team is interested in learning about?

# Schedule a meeting with your instructor 

When the team turns in their responses to this document, please also schedule a time to meet with your instructor to talk about the teams progress to-date.
